# Wildlife Collision Prevention System ðŸ«Ž

## Introduction
In hilly terrains, wildlife frequently crosses roads, posing a significant risk of collisions with vehicles. These collisions can result in injuries and fatalities for both animals and humans. To address this issue, we have developed a Wildlife Collision Prevention System.

Our system leverages OpenCV to detect animals on roads in real-time by analyzing video feeds from roadside cameras. Upon detection, it promptly alerts drivers with visual and auditory signals, effectively mitigating the risk of animal-vehicle collisions and significantly enhancing overall road safety.

## Features
- Real-time animal detection using OpenCV.
- Visual and auditory alerts to drivers upon animal detection.
- Configurable alert thresholds and sensitivity settings.
- Easily integrable with existing roadside camera systems.
- Scalable and adaptable to various terrain conditions.

## Getting Started
To get started with the Wildlife Collision Prevention System, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub:
    ```
    git clone [repository_url]
    ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the system:
    ```
    python main.py
    ```
